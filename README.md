This is a simple, clean, beautiful and non-threatening error page.
The idea behind this was to create an error page that doesn't make the user feel as if they've done something wrong or that their device is somehow broken.

Feel free to customise this to your needs and please send in pull requests if you make it better or have sample configuration files for different servers.

At the moment this requires (linked from CDNs) Google Fonts and Font Awesome.

TODO:
----
- Make it responsive
- Embed Roboto from Google Fonts
- Embed used icons from Font Awesome
- More sample configs

*This design is inspired by an error page by a certain supercharging, flaring cloud CDN service. A big thanks to them.*
